While specific taxes (or quotas) raise average quality, ad valorem taxes may not. The welfare consequences of such policies when the monopolist is a home one and when he/she is a foreign one are discussed. With a home monopolist, both specific and ad valorem subsidies are welfare improving, while with a foreign monopolist their welfare properties depend on the distribution of consumers.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the interaction between price and inventory decisions in retailing firms and its implications for the dynamics of markups and the existence of sales promotions. We consider a model where a monopolistically competitive retailer decides price and inventories, and assumes lump-sum costs when placing orders or changing nominal prices. In this model, the existence of stockout probabilities and fixed ordering costs generate a cyclical price behaviour characterized by long periods without nominal price changes and short periods with very low prices (i.e. sales promotions). We estimate this model using a unique longitudinal dataset with information about retail and wholesale prices, inventories, orders, and sales for several brands in a supermarket chain. Based on the estimated model we perform several counterfactual experiments that show the important role that inventories and fixed ordering costs play in (he dynamics of retail prices and the frequency of sales promotions in this dataset.

@article{Chintagunta2005,
abstract = {The marketing literature has addressed the issues of heterogeneity and endogeneity when estimating a choice model with household-level panel data. When using these data at the stockkeeping unit or the Universal Product Code level, choices for each item in each of the time periods under consideration cannot be observed. Without such information, it is difficult to control for item- and time periodspecific unmeasured characteristics because there is no information on alternatives during those periods in which they are not purchased by any of the panelists. In general, when a product category has many alternatives, each with fairly small shares, the household sample may not contain sufficient choices for each alternative, thus negatively affecting the ability to control for endogeneity with household data. In contrast, because aggregate store-level data (for those stores in which the panel makes purchases) are the aggregation of purchases by all households visiting the stores, the data contain the time periodspecific item-level information required to account for endogeneity as long as each item has some sales in each time period. Given the relative merits of household data to estimate the distribution of heterogeneity and store-level data to address the endogeneity problem, the authors propose an integrated estimation procedure that uses the information in both sources. They provide empirical results from their model using data on the fabric softener market. They extend their approach to situations in which there is variation in purchase quantities that households choose.

@article{Fisher2009,
abstract = {We consider the problem of choosing, from a set of N potential stock-keeping units (SKUs) in a retail category, K SKUs to be carried at each store to maximize revenue or profit. Assortments can vary by store, subject to a maximum number of different assortments. We view a SKU as a set of attribute levels and also model possible substitutions when a customer's first choice is not in the assortment. We apply maximum likelihood estimation to sales history of the SKUs currently carried by the retailer to estimate the demand for attribute levels and substitution probabilities, and from this, the demand for any potential SKU, including those not currently carried by the retailer. We specify several alternative heuristics for choosing SKUs to be carried in an assortment. We apply this approach to optimize assortments for three real examples: snack cakes, tires, and automotive appearance chemicals. A portion of our recommendations for tires and appearance chemicals were implemented and produced sales increases of 5.8{\%} and 3.6{\%}, respectively, which are significant improvements relative to typical retailer annual comparable store revenue increases. We also forecast sales shares of 1, 11, and 25 new SKUs for the snack cake, tire, and automotive appearance chemical applications, respectively, with mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) of 16.2{\%}, 19.1{\%}, and 28.7{\%}, which compares favorably to the 30.7{\%} MAPE for chain sales of two new SKUs reported by Fader and Hardie (1996).
